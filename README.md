# basic-realtime-sound-analysis
Python codes to record sound, analyse frequencies, tones, bpm and key. Real time decomposition of the recorded sound into the frequency domain for display using a GUI (Tkinter).
The scripts can analyse a given recorded sample of sound for the musical notes contained within, and identify the music key that is being played in. These are displayed on Tkinter. This can be used as an aid for those learning instruments for example to know if they are playing the right notes or in key. Can also be used as a springboard for ML applications in the future
